# Security policy

## Scope

V0.1 is a local batch-processing command-line tool. It reads three CSV files, performs a
deterministic reconciliation, and writes terminal, JSON, or CSV reports. It has no network
service, authentication boundary, database, or remote code execution feature.

The process can read and write any path permitted to the operating-system user who runs it. Run
it with ordinary user privileges and review paths before using `--force`.

## Input and output safety

- CSV input is parsed as UTF-8 data with Python's strict CSV parser. Input text is never executed,
  evaluated, or interpolated into a shell command.
- Malformed CSV, invalid UTF-8, invalid schemas, and expected input filesystem errors become
  structured validation errors rather than tracebacks.
- Inputs and reconciliation records are held in memory. Python's CSV parser limits individual
  field size, but V0.1 sets no project-specific file-size or row-count limit. Very large files can
  exhaust local memory or take a long time to process.
- Detailed CSV reports preserve source identifiers exactly. Values beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`,
  or `@` may be treated as formulas by spreadsheet applications. Treat exported CSV as
  potentially untrusted data and import identifier columns as text. V0.1 does not prefix or alter
  values because doing so would break machine-readable round-trip fidelity.
- Report files use UTF-8. Existing files are refused unless `--force` is explicit. Non-forced
  writes use exclusive file creation to preserve this protection even if a destination appears
  after preflight.
- Forced single-file output is written and flushed to a same-directory temporary file before
  replacement. Forced CSV output stages both files before replacing either destination. The two
  final CSV replacements are separate filesystem operations, so the pair is not transactional;
  a failure during the second replacement can leave one new file and one old file.
- An interrupted non-forced write can leave a newly created partial file. The tool never silently
  overwrites that file on the next run.

## Dependencies and data

The application has no third-party runtime dependencies. Development tools are isolated in the
`dev` optional dependency group and monitored weekly by Dependabot, along with GitHub Actions.
The files under `examples/sample_data` are deterministic synthetic fixtures, not customer or
supplier records.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Avoid including sensitive data in a public issue. Use the repository's private vulnerability
reporting option under the GitHub **Security** tab when available. Otherwise, contact the
repository owner through the GitHub profile to agree on a private reporting channel.

A future web deployment will introduce uploads, authentication, authorization, persistence, and
network boundaries. It will require a separate threat model and controls; this policy does not
claim to cover that future system.
